This pack can be used in four ways, that's why you'll find four separate folders:

All together:
Here you'll find a master .blend file with all the outfits, and an FBX with everything too.
You can either open the .blend file in Blender, press the eye icon on the right to turn on the combination of meshes
that you want, select everything by pressing A and export that specific character (remember to check the "Selected Objects" option before exporting)
In engines like Unity, you can import everything (Humans_All.fbx) and just delete what you don't want.

Humanoid Rigs: 
If you want to retarget animations using Unity, use the Humanod Rig versions, they don't have animations but you can retarget 
animations like the ones from Mixamo.

Individual Characters:
In case you don't want to use the modular aspect of this pack, you can just use each individual character
as a separate model, with its own rig and animations.

Separate Skeletal Meshes and Animations:
You can import the set of animations, and the Skeletal Meshes that compose each outfit separately,
and assemble it in your engine, recommended for engines like Unreal Engine.
